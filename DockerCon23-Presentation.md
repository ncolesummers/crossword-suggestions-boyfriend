# WebAssembly, Spin, AI, and Docker Desktop

## What is Wasm (in 30 seconds)

Wasm is an OS and architecture-neutral binary format. You can compile lots of languages to WebAssembly.

---

### Comparisons
* VMs are the heavyweight: Entire OS
* Containers are like a pie slice of an OS
* WebAssembly is just the application (and its files)

---

### Three big advantages:
1. It is secure
2. It is really, really fast to start
3. Write once, run anywhere

---

## Spin
Spin is the open source developer tool for building serverless WebAssembly apps.

(Serverless means: Writing event handlers, not server daemons)

## Over to some Code

We're going to play with a crossword puzzle helper.
